# Protocol findings — `drunkdeer.keybord.net.cn` bundle

Extracted 2026-05-22 from `https://drunkdeer.keybord.net.cn/drunk/index.html` →
`./js/index.QC8Mvgui.js` (6.14 MB Vite-built bundle). Raw bundle saved at
[tools/captures/keybord-net-cn/](../tools/captures/keybord-net-cn/) for
re-derivation.

This is a **different deployment** from the `drunkdeer-antler.com` source
that `docs/keyboard-protocol.md` was originally extracted from. The two
bundles share the same protocol vocabulary but the newer one has
materially richer wire formats, additional features (RGB, knob,
firmware-side multi-profile), and **changes to behaviour we previously
believed was settled** (RDT pair packets, per-key sensitivity wire
format).

This document lists everything new or different from our current
`Driver/Packets.cs` and `docs/keyboard-protocol.md`. Each finding is
flagged P0/P1/P2 by suspected priority.

## P0: phantom-RDT bug suspect — `sendCreateRdtData` IS used

Our `Driver/Packets.cs` comment says:
> Release-Dual-Trigger does NOT have its own pair-table packet on the
> wire. The JS bundle defines `sendCreateRdtData` ([0xFC, 0x03, count, …])
> but the official driver does NOT actually emit it during RDT save —
> verified by WebHID intercept of drunkdeer.com (2026-05-20).

**That's not true on `keybord.net.cn`.** The new bundle calls
`sendCreateRdtData(Q)` unconditionally when entering RDT mode:

```js
let C = NA().sendClearRtpData(e);  // fc 0a (mode)
// ... write C, await ack ...
if (A === "lw") {
  let E = NA().sendCreateLwData(Q);  // fc 01 (LW pairs)
  // ... write E, await ack ...
} else {
  let E = NA().sendCreateRdtData(Q); // fc 03 (RDT pairs)  ← we never send this
  // ... write E, await ack ...
}
```

**Wire format** of `sendCreateRdtData(B)`:

```
B[0] = 0xFC
B[1] = 0x03
B[2] = pair count
for each pair (8 bytes per entry, starting at B[3]):
  +0  = main_slot   (press key, byte)
  +1  = trigger_slot (release key, byte)
  +2  = active_lo   ((x2Active - main.upstroke) * 200, clamped 10..50)
  +3  = active_hi
  +4  = reset_lo    ((x2Reset - main.upstroke) * 200, clamped 300..500)
  +5  = reset_hi
  +6  = 0
  +7  = 0
```

`x2Active` and `x2Reset` are per-pair thresholds. Defaults observed:
`active ≈ 0.05-0.25 mm`, `reset ≈ 1.5-2.5 mm`. The thresholds are
**relative to the main key's upstroke point** — `(x2Active - main.upstroke)`.

**Why this likely matters for the phantom-RDT bug:** without `fc 03`,
the firmware never receives proper per-pair RDT registration. Our
RDT pairs activate via Type-4 remap entries + RtpAuthority/Download
packets, which mostly works — but on profile-switch the firmware's
internal pair-state is half-configured, and stale entries can bleed
through. The phantom-fires-on-release symptom user observed
2026-05-22 lines up exactly with this.

**Action**: implement `BuildCreateRdtPacket(pairs, thresholds)` in
`Packets.cs`, wire it into `BuildFullProfilePackets` for RDT-mode
syncs, test on A75 Pro 0x0017. If it fixes the phantom, this is
the answer. If not, deeper investigation needed.

**Caveat**: the threshold values (`x2Active`, `x2Reset`) come from a
per-pair UI in the official tool that we don't currently expose.
We'd need either reasonable defaults (e.g. active=0.1mm,
reset=2.0mm) or a per-pair editor in our UI.

---

## P0: per-model dialect dispatch (we likely get it wrong for parts of the lineup)

The bundle dispatches per-key wire format based on **type bytes** and
**firmware version**:

```js
// type bytes Q.A.e = identity-response bytes 4/5/6
if      (Q===0x0B && A===0x01 && e===0x01) precision=1, oldOpenHighPrecision=false  // G65 (one variant)
else if (Q===0x0B && A===0x04 && e===0x01) precision=1, oldOpenHighPrecision=false  // A75 ANSI
else if (Q===0x0B && A===0x04 && e===0x04) precision=2, oldOpenHighPrecision=false  // A75 Ultra
                                           keyboard_type = 756
// per-model firmware-version cutoffs that PROMOTE old → new high-precision:
else if (model === A75base    && fw >= 0x23) precision=2, oldOpenHighPrecision=true
else if (model === A75Pro     && fw >= 0x11) precision=2, oldOpenHighPrecision=true
else if (model === A75iso     && fw >= 0x19) precision=2, oldOpenHighPrecision=true
```

`fw` is `a` in the JS — decoded from the identity response (probably
byte index 25 based on `E.getUint8(25)` calls in the same block,
though `a` itself is set elsewhere).

### Three cases unpack to:

| precision | oldOpenHighPrecision | Packet ID | Bytes/key | Scale | Keys/pkt | Total pkts |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | false | 0xB6 | 1 | mm × 10 | 59 + 8 | 3 |
| 2 | **true** | 0xB6 | 1 | mm × 100 | 59 + 8 | 3 |
| 2 | false | **0xFD** | **2** | mm × 200 | 30 × 4 + 6 | 5 |

### What our `Driver/Packets.cs` actually implements

Single path: case **(2, true)** — `0xB6` packets, 1 byte/key, mm × 100.

**Where this is correct** ✅:
- A75 Pro on firmware ≥ 0x11 (covers the verified 0x17 and the dropped
  0x09 path). Matches user's A75 Pro 0x0017.
- A75 base on firmware ≥ 0x23.
- A75 ISO on firmware ≥ 0x19.

**Where this is BROKEN** ❌:
- **G65 / A75 ANSI on legacy firmware (and likely G75 / G60)** → they
  want `precision=1` (mm × 10). We send mm × 100. The firmware
  interprets our 0.5mm AP as 5.0mm — every key effectively won't
  trigger. CLAUDE.md says G65 was "tested on v0.48" so either that
  test was on a different code path or the bug was masked.
- **A75 Ultra (TypeCode 756) and A75 Master (TypeCode 757)** → they
  want `precision=2, oldOpenHighPrecision=false` (0xFD packets, 2
  bytes/key, mm × 200). We send 0xB6 / 1 byte / mm × 100. **The
  firmware silently rejects or mis-interprets the packets.** This is
  likely why we have zero verified hardware reports on A75 Ultra /
  Master despite users on those models.

**Action**: per-firmware sensitivity packet dispatch in `Packets.cs`.
The `FirmwareCapabilities` record needs a `Precision` enum field
(Legacy / OldHighPrec / NewHighPrec), set during `KeyboardSpecs`
parsing. `BuildPacketKeyPoint` becomes a dispatcher. Real
cross-keyboard correctness fix — but should land alongside read-back
verification (Pull* variants) so we can confirm the bytes commit.

## P0: two protocol dialects for per-key AP/DS/US

The bundle defines TWO complete sets of `sendActionPointData` /
`sendDownStokeData` / `sendUpStrokeData` builders, dispatched by:

```js
A.precision === 2 && !A.oldOpenHighPrecision
  ? newDialect  // 0xFD packets, 2 bytes/key, mm × 200
  : oldDialect  // 0xB6 packets, 1 byte/key, mm × 100 or × 10
```

### Old dialect (what `Driver/Packets.cs` currently implements)

```
sendActionPointData(B, C):
  E[0] = 0xB6
  E[1] = 0x01     // 0x04 for DS, 0x05 for US
  E[2] = 0
  E[3] = C        // packet number 0/1/2
  // 59 keys per packet × 2 + 8 in packet 2 = 126 keys
  // 1 byte per key value: mm × 100 if oldOpenHighPrecision, else mm × 10
```

This matches our current code (mm × 100 after the AP wire-scale fix in
commit `23646cf`). The `× 10` legacy branch is what we ripped out as
part of the 0.09 drop.

### New dialect (what we DON'T have)

```
sendActionPointData(B, C):
  E[0] = 0xFD
  E[1] = 0x01     // 0x04 for DS, 0x05 for US
  E[2] = C        // packet number 0..4 (5 packets total)
  // 30 keys per packet × 4 + 6 in packet 4 = 126 keys
  // 2 bytes per key value (lo + hi), mm × 200 — half-millimetre precision
```

`mm × 200` means a 16-bit value covering 0..512 for 0..2.56mm, with
0.005mm steps. That's 40× finer than the old format's 0.01mm step.

**Which firmwares prefer which dialect** is gated by
`precision === 2 && !oldOpenHighPrecision`. We don't yet know how
`precision` is set — likely from a spec response byte we currently
ignore. Need to capture identity-packet bytes from a newer firmware
(A75 Ultra 0x55, A75 Master 0x55, A75 ANSI 0x27) to determine the
mapping.

**Action**: add high-precision builders alongside the existing ones,
gate behind a capability check that reads the precision byte from
spec response. **Don't switch unilaterally** — A75 Pro 0x0017 has been
verified working on the old dialect, no need to migrate that path.

## P1: RGB / lighting — DEEP DIVE

### Full mode catalog (color1..color26)

Names from the English locale block (`color1:"..."` etc.) in the bundle.
Each mode has a 1-based code that goes into the wire packet's B[4]
position.

| Code | Mode | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
| 1  | Lighting turn off | All LEDs off |
| 2  | Rotate Marquee | Marquee rotates around perimeter |
| 3  | Wave Spectrum | Diagonal colour wave |
| 4  | Surf to the right | Horizontal wave L→R |
| 5  | Breath | Pulse single colour |
| 6  | Center Surfing | Wave from centre outward |
| 7  | Spectrum | Static rainbow gradient |
| 8  | Ripple | Ripple from key press |
| 9  | Always light | Static colour (no animation) |
| 10 | Light by press | LEDs off until key pressed |
| 11 | Serpentine to the center | Snake wave converging |
| 12 | Colorful fountain | Random colour fountain |
| 13 | Laser Key | Laser line from key press |
| 14 | Glowing Fish | Fish swims across |
| 15 | Surfing Cross | Cross-pattern wave |
| 16 | Heart | Heart shape pulsing |
| 17 | Traffic | Traffic-light cycle |
| 18 | Gluttonous Snake | Snake game pattern |
| 19 | Raindrops | Random fading drops |
| 20 | Turbo mode light | Highlights Turbo-bound keys |
| 21 | **Custom light** | Per-key static colours (see below) |
| 22 | Stars | Twinkle pattern |
| 23 | Surfing down | Vertical wave top→bottom |
| 24 | Repeat Surfing | Surf back-and-forth |
| 25 | Random Fountain | Random colour bursts |
| 26 | Dance of Demons | Frantic colour chaos |

### `sendLedModeData` — set the active mode

```
B[0] = 0xAE
B[1] = 0x01
B[2] = 0x00
B[3] = (mode index in colour_array, usually 0)
B[4] = mode_code (1..26 from the table above)
B[5] = ??? (one of brightness/speed/colour_select)
B[6] = ??? (another of brightness/speed/colour_select)
B[7] = 0
```

Definition (from the JS bundle):
```js
sendLedModeData:(B,C,E,a,r)=>{
  const t=new Uint8Array(63);
  return t[0]=174, t[1]=1, t[2]=0,
         t[3]=B, t[4]=C, t[5]=E, t[6]=a, t[7]=r, t
}
```

Call site:
```js
event_set_led_mode(0, c, C, B, 0)
// where c = mode_code (post-precision dispatch), C and B come from
// the colour-panel UI (brightness slider + speed slider, but exact
// mapping needs a WebHID capture to confirm)
```

`apiSaveColourSolution(D, p.value, Number(s.value), ...)` is the
entry point — `D` is the current mode index, `p.value` is one slider
value (suspected brightness), `s.value` is the other (suspected
speed). The 4th and 5th apiSaveColourSolution params (the picked
colour for monochrome modes like Breath / Always light) propagate
to wire bytes 5/6/7 in some order — needs WebHID capture for the
exact assignment.

### `sendTurboLedModeData` — multi-packet stream

Used for modes that need per-key colour data (currently observed for
Turbo mode = code 20). Each packet carries up to 13 keys × 4 bytes
(slot+r+g+b). Multiple packets chained until a `0xFF` terminator.

```
B[0] = 0xAE
B[1] = 0x01
B[2] = mode (= 20 for Turbo)
B[3] = 0x00
B[4] = (mode-specific param)
B[5] = 0x06
B[6] = (mode-specific param)
B[7] = 0xFF
B[8..] = packed [slot0, r0, g0, b0, slot1, r1, g1, b1, ...]
         terminated with 0xFF byte after last entry
```

JS source:
```js
sendTurboLedModeData:(B,C,E,a)=>{
  const r=new Uint8Array(63);
  r[0]=174, r[1]=1, r[2]=B, r[3]=0,
  r[4]=C, r[5]=6, r[6]=a, r[7]=255,
  E.push(0,0,0);  // padding
  let t=0;
  for(let I=0;I<E.length;I++)
    t++,
    I%4===0 ? r[8+I]=E[I] : r[8+I]=+("0x"+E[I]);
  return t===0 ? r[8]=+"0xff" : r[t+5]=+"0xff", r
}
```

### `sendSetLedData` — X60-only

```
B[0] = 0xC2
B[1] = 0x20
B[2..5] = 4 bytes
```

Only called when `keyboard_type === 603` (the X60 model — TypeCode
603). Almost certainly LED strip control on the X60's underlight.
Skip for the main lineup.

### `buildPkt_custom_led_mode_select` — Custom Light (mode 21) packing

```js
// Builds the per-key colour stream for mode 21 (Custom light).
// Q is a 2D array of {color: "#rrggbb", value: slotIdx} cells.
for (let c=0; c<Q.length; c++)
  for (let m=0; m<Q[c].length; m++) {
    let a = Q[c][m].color ? Q[c][m].color.slice(1,3) : 0  // r hex
    let r = Q[c][m].color ? Q[c][m].color.slice(3,5) : 0  // g hex
    let t = Q[c][m].color ? Q[c][m].color.slice(5,7) : 0  // b hex
    I.push(128 + Q[c][m].value, a, r, t)  // 0x80|slot, r, g, b
  }
// I is then chunked and sent via sendTurboLedModeData
```

So Custom Light wire encoding per-key entry is **4 bytes**:
`[0x80 | slotIndex, R, G, B]`. The 0x80 OR sets a high bit on slot —
firmware uses this to distinguish "user-coloured" slots from
inactive ones in the same stream.

### Capability gating

```js
A.version_feature_switch.color
```

The `color` feature flag on `version_feature_switch` gates whether the
RGB UI tabs are shown at all. Some keyboards report `color = false`
and the official tool hides the entire Colour panel — likely the
G65/G60 family which have no per-key RGB.

### Localised UI strings (English)

```
color_title:      "Lighting settings"
color_brightness: "Lighting brightness"
color_speed:      "Lighting speed"
color_bg:         "Lighting colour"
ledstrip_title:   "LED Strip Settings"
ledstrip_brightness, ledstrip_speed, ledstrip_color: (X60-only)
```

### Localised UI strings (Chinese, for the i18n roadmap)

```
color_title:      "灯效设置"
color_brightness: "灯效亮度"
color_speed:      "灯效速度"
color_bg:         "颜色"
```

### What we can build right now without hardware

Even without a WebHID capture confirming the exact param mapping for
bytes 5/6 of `sendLedModeData`, we can:

1. Land the mode-code enum and the wire packet builder
2. Ship a minimal Colour tab UI: a mode picker (dropdown of the 26
   modes), a single colour swatch, brightness + speed sliders
3. Map "set mode" → `sendLedModeData(0, mode_code, brightness, speed, 0)`
   as a first guess
4. Persist last-used mode + colour + sliders in `Settings`
5. Gate on `version_feature_switch.color` analogue (we don't have
   that flag yet but A75 Pro definitely supports RGB so we can
   unconditionally show the UI on supported models)

The first-pass param mapping (5=brightness, 6=speed) might be wrong —
a hardware capture from the official tool will lock it down. Worst
case is one swapped byte and an easy follow-up commit. Best case is
it works.

---

## P1: knob / dial wire format

`sendKnobEventData(B, C, E)`:
```
a[0] = 0xC1, a[1] = 0x03
a[2] = C, a[3] = E, a[4] = 0
// then by keyType of the remapItem:
// type 0: a[5] = keyCmd, a[7] = keyCode
// type 1: a[5] = keyCmd, a[6] = keyCode
// type 2: a[5] = keyCmd, a[6] = keyCode
// type 3: a[5] = keyCmd
```

Models with a physical knob (A75 Ultra, A75 Master) can remap the
knob's CW/CCW/click actions via this packet. We don't expose knob
remap today.

**Action**: roadmap item, gated on having a knob-equipped keyboard
to test against.

---

## P1: firmware-side multi-profile management

The keyboard apparently stores multiple profiles internally and can
switch between them via wire:

| Function | Wire | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sendProfileLen(B)` | `[0xA2, B, …]` | set/query profile count |
| `sendDelProfileData(B)` | `[0xAB, B, …]` | delete firmware-side profile slot B |
| `sendChangeProfileIndex()` | `[0xFB, 0x05, idx, id0, id1, …]` | switch active firmware-side profile |

Today our app treats profiles as host-side JSON files that get fully
pushed to the keyboard on switch. A firmware-side multi-profile model
would let us:
- Switch profiles instantly (no full re-sync)
- Have profiles persist across host disconnect (kbd remembers last
  active even when disconnected from PC)
- Match the official tool's behaviour exactly

`profileIndex` appears 17+ times in the bundle — heavily used.

**Action**: roadmap item, significant scope. Would change the entire
profile sync architecture. Worth scoping but not urgent — host-side
push works fine for our use case.

---

## P1: read-back capability ("Pull" variants)

| Function | Wire |
|---|---|
| `sendPullActionPointData()` | `[0xFD, 0x07, 0x01, …]` |
| `sendPullDownStokeData()` | `[0xFD, 0x07, 0x03, …]` |
| `sendPullUpStrokeData()` | `[0xFD, 0x07, 0x04, …]` |

Request firmware to send back current per-key AP/DS/US values. The
response packets presumably mirror the SET packets in format (0xFD
01/04/05 with the same packet-number layout, 2-byte values).

We currently can't read per-key state from the firmware — we treat
the host-side profile JSON as authoritative. Read-back would let us:
- Detect "user edited via official tool then opened our app" (state
  drift between firmware and our cached JSON)
- Import the firmware's actual state as a new profile
- Roundtrip-verify a sync actually committed (read back, compare,
  warn on mismatch)

**Action**: roadmap item, useful diagnostic but not a feature gap.

---

## P1: factory reset wire packet

`sendResetKeyboardData`:
```
B[0] = 0xAA  // single byte, rest zero
```

Simpler than I expected — just `aa 00 …`. Our app's "Reset all keys"
button currently fakes this by sending AP=2.0, DS=0, US=0 across all
126 slots (9 packets × ack). A single `aa 00` is presumably faster
and resets everything (remaps, pairs, RGB, etc.) at once.

**Action**: small wire-level cleanup. Verify on hardware that `aa 00`
actually resets ALL state (not just per-key sensitivity), then
replace our reset implementation with it. Low risk, low effort.

---

## P2: protocol functions confirmed unchanged

These match our existing implementations byte-for-byte:

| Function | Wire | Our impl |
|---|---|---|
| `sendCommonData` | `[0xB5, 0, 0x1E, 1, 0, 0, 1, turbo, rt, 0, lw\|rdt, rtmatch]` | `BuildCommonSwitchPacket` |
| `sendClearRTPData` | `[0xAA, 0, 1, …]` | `BuildClearRtpUpperPacket` |
| `sendClearRtpData(mode=2)` | `[0xFC, 0x0A, mode, …]` | `BuildClearRtpPacket` |
| `sendRTPAuthorityData(B)` | `[0xA7, B, 0, 0x2B, 1, …]` | `BuildPacketRTPAuthority` |
| `sendCreateLwData(B)` | `[0xFC, 0x01, 0, count, m0, t0, 0, 0, …]` | `BuildCreateLwPairsPacket` |
| `sendLwReplaceData(B)` | `[0xFC, 0x0B, B, …]` | `BuildLastWinReplacePacket` |
| `sendIdentityData` | `[0xA0, 0x02, …]` | `IDENTITY_PACKET` |

---

## P0: complete identity-packet byte map (NEW from response parser)

The firmware's response to `sendIdentityData` (request `[0xA0, 0x02]`)
comes back as a 0xA0 packet whose full byte layout was extracted from
the bundle's `case 160:` handler. **Significantly richer than what
`Driver/KeyboardSpecs.cs` currently parses** — RGB state, current
profile index, RTMatch state, and AutoMatchMode are all here.

```
Byte  Field                          Notes
----  -----------------------------  ----------------------------------
[0]   0xA0                           Packet ID (matched by case 160)
[1]   0x02                           Sub-id (C)
[2]   mode                           Must be 0 for a spec response

[4]   typeBytes[0]                   Model identifier triple

[16]  rtvalue                        0/1 — Rapid Trigger enabled
[18]  rtdvalue                       0/1 — RDT enabled
[19]  lwvalue                        0/1 — LW enabled
[20]  profileIndex *                 Active firmware-side profile slot
[22]  colormodel *                   Current RGB mode code (1..26)
[23]  colorspeed *                   RGB animation speed
[24]  brightness *                   RGB brightness
[30]  rtMatchValue                   0/1 — RT match enabled
[31]  autoMatchModeIndex             0..N — AutoMatch mode
[32]  lw_replace                     0/1 — LW Replace enabled
[25]  (some value used as `a`)       Source of firmware-version cutoff
                                     in the precision dispatch table
```

`*` = only meaningful when `precision === 2 && !oldOpenHighPrecision`
(i.e. NewHighPrec firmware — A75 Ultra / A75 Master). On older
dialects these bytes might be reserved or carry different meaning.

**What our `KeyboardSpecs` currently parses**: [4..6, 7, 8, 15, 16,
18, 19, 30, 31, 32]. **What we're missing**: [20] profileIndex,
[22] colormodel, [23] colorspeed, [24] brightness.

**Action**: extend `KeyboardSpecs` to read bytes 20/22/23/24 when
present. Surfaces the firmware's current RGB state in our UI without
needing to track host-side state separately.

## P0: full firmware-response inbound packet handler map

The bundle's main `received_report_handle` switch (extracted from the
`case 160:` and surrounding cases) is the source of truth for what
the firmware sends and how it's interpreted. Map below.

| ID  | Sub | Direction | Meaning |
|-----|-----|-----------|---------|
| 0xA0 | 0x02 | in  | Spec response (see byte map above) |
| 0xA2 | 0x?? | in  | Profile-length echo (after sendProfileLen) |

| 0xFD | 0x0A | in  | Downstroke read-back response |
| 0xFD | 0x0B | in  | Upstroke read-back response |

**Request → response subcommand pattern**: pull-back responses are
`request_sub + 1` (e.g. AP request `fd 07 01` → response `fd 08`).

### High-precision keystroke tracking (`0xFD 0x06`) — full format

```
B[0] = 0xFD
B[1] = 0x06
B[2] = chunk index (0..4)
B[3..] = 30 keys × 2 bytes (lo, hi) at mm × 200 raw
         chunk 4 only carries 6 keys
```

Deadzone: raw < 40 → treated as 0 (40 raw at mm × 200 = 0.20 mm).
Cycle complete signal fires after chunk 4. Our existing
`HidStreamListener.ParseHighPrecision` mostly matches this; worth a
re-read against the JS to confirm chunk count + dead-zone threshold.

### Low-precision keystroke tracking (`0xB7`) — confirmed

```
B[0] = 0xB7
B[1] = 0x00 (always 0)
B[2] = chunk index (0, 1, 2)
B[3] = unused?
B[4..] = 59 keys × 1 byte
         chunk 2 only carries 8 keys (last 8 of 126)
```

Scale depends on `oldOpenHighPrecision`:
- true (OldHighPrec) → byte / 200 * 100 = percent of 2 mm max
- false (Legacy) → byte / (bg * 10) * 100 where bg ≈ 3.8 (full travel)

## P0: NEW pull-back packets (sendPullLw, sendPullRdt)

Adding to the Pull* inventory documented above:

| Function | Wire | Response (inbound) |
|---|---|---|
| `sendPullLw()` | `[0xFC, 0x05]` | `[0xFC, 0x06, ...]` LW pair table |
| `sendPullRdt()` | `[0xFC, 0x07]` | `[0xFC, 0x08, ...]` RDT pair table |

Round-trip lets the host learn the firmware's current LW + RDT pair
tables — useful for the "user edited via official tool" detection
roadmap item, AND for verifying our `sendCreateLwData` / new
`sendCreateRdtData` writes actually committed.

---

## P0: full RGB packing for Custom Light (mode 21)

The Custom Light mode (`color21`) uses `sendTurboLedModeData` with a
per-key colour stream. Wire encoding per-key:

```
4 bytes per coloured key:
  [0x80 | slotIndex, R, G, B]
```

Build flow (from `buildPkt_custom_led_mode_select`):
```js
for each row, for each cell:
  const r = color ? parseInt(color.slice(1,3), 16) : 0   // RR
  const g = color ? parseInt(color.slice(3,5), 16) : 0   // GG
  const b = color ? parseInt(color.slice(5,7), 16) : 0   // BB
  bytes.push(0x80 | slot, r, g, b)
// chunk and send via sendTurboLedModeData
```

The `0x80` high bit marks "user-coloured" — firmware uses it to
distinguish styled slots from defaults in the same packet stream.

---

## P0: full apiXxx surface (the official tool's public API)

Extracted as the complete list of `api*(` patterns in the bundle.
Useful as a "what features does the official tool have" reference.

**Profile management**:
- `apiProfileCreateNew`, `apiProfileDelete`, `apiProfileDuplicate`,
  `apiProfileReset`
- `apiProfileChangeName`, `apiProfileChangeRTMatch`,
  `apiProfileChangeTurboAndRP`, `apiProfileChangeBySlider`
- `apiProfileRtp` (RTP per-profile settings)
- `apiImportProfile`, `apiLoadProfiles`, `apiGetAllProfiles`,
  `apiGetAllProfileNames`
- `apiDelProfile` (firmware-side delete)

**Remap**:
- `apiRemapNew`, `apiRemapCreateMap`, `apiRemapDelete`,
  `apiRemapDeleteMap`, `apiRemapDuplicate`
- `apiRemapChangeName`
- `apiRemapImport`, `apiRemapLoadProfile`, `apiRemapResetAllKeys`,
  `apiRemapSaveToKeyboard`
- `apiRemapGetDefaultKey`, `apiRemapGetKeyDesc`, `apiRemapGetKeys`,
  `apiRemapGetProfile`, `apiRemapGetProfileNames`,
  `apiRemapGetProfiles`

**Colour / RGB**:
- `apiSaveColourSolution`, `apiSaveCustomColourSolution`
- `apiGetAllColours`, `apiGetColours`, `apiLoadColours`
- `apiGetAllLedStrips`, `apiGetLedStripColors`, `apiLoadLedStrips`
  (X60-only LED strip)

**RTMatch / knob**:
- `apiRTMatch`
- `apiSetKnobData` (wraps `sendKnobEventData(Q, A, e)` directly)

## P0: complete keyboard dispatch + per-model feature flags

The JS bundle has a complete per-model dispatch with feature
capability flags gated by firmware version. Far richer than our
current model resolution.

### Full type-bytes → TypeCode dispatch

Identity-response bytes 4, 5, 6 (named Q, A, e in the JS) →
TypeCode. Extracted from the dispatch chain in the bundle's
device-detection function. Adds 4 models we don't yet have in
`Driver/KeyboardModels.cs`.

| Q.A.e | TypeCode | Model | Notes |
|-------|---------:|-------|-------|
| 11.1.1 | 75 | A75 ANSI | Legacy alias for A75 |
| 11.4.1 | 75 | A75 ANSI | Primary |
| 11.4.1 | 82 | **K82** | **NEW** — disambiguated from A75 by something else (maybe fw cutoff) |
| 11.4.4 | 756 | A75 Ultra | `precision=2`, NewHighPrec dialect |
| 11.5.4 | 757 | A75 Master | `precision=2`, NewHighPrec dialect |
| 11.4.3 | 750 | A75 Pro | OldHighPrec at fw ≥ 0x11 |
| 11.4.2 | 751 / 752 / 753 | A75 UK / FR / DE | ISO. Variant disambiguated via `localStorage["current_iso"]` |
| 11.4.5 | 754 | G75 ANSI | |
| 11.4.7 | 755 | G75 JP | |
| 11.2.1 | 65 | G65 ANSI | Primary |
| 15.1.1 | 65 | G65 ANSI | Legacy alias |
| 11.2.3 | 651 | G65m1 | |
| 11.16.1 | 652 | G65m2 | |
| 11.18.1 | 653 | G65m3 | |
| 11.2.5 | 650 | G65 Lite | |
| 11.3.1 | 60 | G60 ANSI | |
| 11.3.3 | 600 | G60m1 | |
| 11.19.1 | 601 | G60m2 | |
| 11.21.1 | 602 | G60m3 | |
| 11.6.5 | 603 | X60 | LED strip + RtMathMode supported |

### Per-keyboard RTP firmware-version cutoffs (`RTP_version` table)

Firmware version at which RTP / RDT / LW features become available:

```
{
  75: 0x18,  750: 0x05,  751: 0x15,  752: 0x15,  753: 0x15,
  60: 0x11,  600: 0x01,  601: 0x01,  602: 0x01,  603: 0x01,
  65: 0x09,  650: 0x01,  651: 0x01,  652: 0x01,  653: 0x01,
  754: 0x05, 755: 0x02,
  756: 0x01, 757: 0x01,
}
```

Below the cutoff, RTP UI is hidden in the official tool. Implies
our pre-RTP fw users (if any) shouldn't see RDT / LW UI either.

### Per-family custom lighting cutoffs (`custom_lighting_version` table)

Firmware version at which the Custom Light (RGB mode 21) per-key
colour feature becomes available:

```
{
  A75: 0x14,
  A75iso: 0x13,
  A75pro: 0x03,
  G75: 0x04,
  G65: 0x07,
  G60: 0x07,
  X60: 0x01,
  G75JP: 0x01,
}
```

### Per-model other capability cutoffs

```
firmware_synchronization: { 757: 0x21, 756: 0x21 }
  → Only A75 Ultra/Master, only at fw ≥ 0x21
  → Gates the Pull* read-back feature (HighPrecision_firmware_synchronization_to_driver
    in the JS)

rtMathMode: { 757: 0x25, 756: 0x25, 603: 0x01 }
  → A75 Ultra/Master (fw ≥ 0x25) + X60
  → Unknown what "rt math mode" actually does. NOT the same as RTMatch.

rtMathBtn: { 757: 0x20, 756: 0x20 }
  → A75 Ultra/Master only, fw ≥ 0x20
  → Related to rtMathMode — probably the in-UI button to engage it.
```

### `version_feature_switch` runtime flags

The `useKeyboardStore.version_feature_switch` object is set per-device
on connect, exposing capability flags to the rest of the UI:

| Flag | Source | Gates |
|---|---|---|
| `rtp` | `fw >= RTP_version[type]` | RTP/RDT/LW UI surface |
| `color` | (table not yet extracted) | Colour tab visibility |
| `firmware_synchronization` | `fw >= firmware_synchronization[type]` | Pull*/read-back |
| `rtMathMode` | `fw >= rtMathMode[type]` | RT math mode UI |
| `rtMathBtn` | `fw >= rtMathBtn[type]` | RT math button UI |

**Action**: extend `FirmwareCapabilities` from a simple Tier enum
into a feature-flag record. Concrete proposal:

```csharp
public sealed record FirmwareCapabilities {
  // existing: Label, Tier, Precision, IsTooOld, RecommendedFloor, ...
  public bool HasRtp { get; init; }
  public bool HasCustomLighting { get; init; }
  public bool HasFirmwareSync { get; init; }
  public bool HasRtMathMode { get; init; }
}
```

Computed in `Resolve()` from the cutoff tables above.

### ISO variant disambiguation (UK / FR / DE share TypeCode 751)

When type-bytes are 11.4.2 (A75 ISO), the JS doesn't know which
language variant the user has — UK, FR, and DE keyboards all report
the same TypeCode. Disambiguation:

```js
let r = Number(localStorage.getItem("current_iso")) || 751;
if (![751, 752, 753].includes(r)) r = 751;
if (r === 751) { /* A75 UK profile */ }
else if (r === 752) { /* A75 FR profile */ }
else if (r === 753) { /* A75 DE profile */ }
```

The user picks their variant in the UI; persists in localStorage.
We do **not** disambiguate today — A75 UK/FR/DE all map to TypeCode
751 with the same label. Doesn't matter for protocol but does for
keycap labels in the editor.

---

## P0: sendCommonData parameter sources (byte-by-byte)

The bundle's `sendCommonData()` is parameter-free — it reads state
from a global `keyboardObj` store. Full source mapping:

```js
sendCommonData: () => {
  const B = new Uint8Array(63);
  B[0] = 0xB5;
  B[1] = 0x00;
  B[2] = 0x1E;
  B[3] = 0x01;
  B[4] = 0x00;
  B[5] = 0x00;
  B[6] = 0x01;
  B[7] = Number(o.keyboardObj.turboMode);
  B[8] = Number(o.keyboardObj.rapidTriggerMode);
  B[9] = 0;
  let C = 0;
  if (o.keyboardObj.lwMode && o.keyboardObj.rdtMode) C = 3;
  else if (o.keyboardObj.lwMode) C = 1;
  else if (o.keyboardObj.rdtMode) C = 2;
  B[10] = C;
  B[11] = Number(o.keyboardObj.RTMatch);
  return B;
}
```

Matches our `BuildCommonSwitchPacket` byte-for-byte. ✅

---

## P0: profile data model (host-side schema)

Per-profile structure stored in localStorage:

```
storagename:           string  // internal key (e.g. "ddeerA75ProProfile1")
nameIndex:             number  // index in the name list
showname:              string  // user-visible name
isActive:              bool    // synced to firmware as one of N profile slots
id:                    number  // profile ID for firmware-side reference
keys_array:            Array[126] of {action_point, downstroke, upstroke}
                                     plus per-key metadata
// + RTP / LW / RDT settings, etc.
```

Profile management methods:
- `m_profile_array.push(p)` — append
- `IsProfileNameExist(name)` — check unique
- `getProfileByName(name)` / `getProfileByStorageName(key)`
- `apiProfileCreateNew(name?)` — auto-increment suffix until unique
- `apiProfileDelete`, `apiProfileDuplicate`, `apiProfileReset`

### Colour profile (separate from key profile!) — `Xw` class

```js
class Xw {
  constructor(storagename, nameIndex, use_preset, index,
              colour_mode, colourful, bright, speed,
              title, _name, code) {
    this.storagename = storagename;
    this.nameIndex = nameIndex;
    this.use_preset = use_preset;
    this.index = index;
    this.colour_mode = colour_mode;
    this.colourful = colourful;
    this.bright = bright;
    this.speed = speed;
    this.title = title;
    this._name = _name;
    this.code = code;
  }
}
```

So RGB lighting profiles are STORED SEPARATELY from key profiles —
the user can have multiple lighting solutions and pick one
independent of their key-config profile. The `code` field is the
mode code (1..26), `bright` and `speed` are slider values,
`colourful` is presumably the per-key colour array (for mode 21
Custom light) or a single tint colour (for mode 5 Breath etc).

We don't have a separate colour-profile model in our app. If we
land RGB support, we'd want to mirror this structure — multiple
saved lighting configs per user, independent of key profiles.

---

## P1: knob event mapping (full extraction)

`sendKnobEventData(B, C, E)`:

```
B[0] = 0xC1
B[1] = 0x03
B[2] = C                // knob event ID (1..6, see below)
B[3] = E                // 1 = binding, 0 = clearing the binding
B[4] = 0
// then by keyType of B.remapItem (only when E === 1):
//   keyType 0: B[5] = keyCmd, B[7] = keyCode    (HID key)
//   keyType 1: B[5] = keyCmd, B[6] = keyCode    (?)
//   keyType 2: B[5] = keyCmd, B[6] = keyCode    (?)
//   keyType 3: B[5] = keyCmd                     (no code)
```

### Knob event IDs (C parameter)

The JS resets all knob bindings with:
```js
for (let y=0; y<6; y++) apiSetKnobData(null, y+1, 0);
```

So C ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} — 6 distinct knob events. Likely
breakdown (unconfirmed without a knob keyboard to test):

- 1, 2: Knob 0 — CW / CCW rotation
- 3: Knob 0 — Click
- 4, 5: Knob 1 — CW / CCW rotation
- 6: Knob 1 — Click

Models with knobs are A75 Ultra (TypeCode 756) and A75 Master
(TypeCode 757). Each has a single knob (per product photos), so
6 events suggests either 3 per knob × 2 knobs (Ultra + Master are
the same hardware platform, both have 1 knob) OR it's 6 distinct
"click levels" / shifted-rotation events per single knob. The
official tool's knob UI has 3-6 binding slots depending on model.

---

## P1: official tool's locale catalog (i18n SOURCE for our roadmap)

The bundle ships **~600 unique English UI strings** professionally
translated into 7 locales:

| Code | Language |
|---|---|
| `en` | English |
| `cn` | Simplified Chinese (default for keybord.net.cn) |
| `tw` | Traditional Chinese |
| `jp` | Japanese |
| `kr` | Korean |
| `fr` | French |
| `de` | German |

**For our i18n roadmap item**: these translations can be lifted
directly — they're already in the JS bundle as object literals.
Saves the "needs native-speaker review" cost on at least the
DrunkDeer-vocabulary strings (key names, mode names, button labels)
since they're the source's own translations.

Extraction pattern: search for `currentLanguage:"cn"` to find the
locale switcher; the locale objects live nearby. Strings keyed by
identifier like `"trigger_settings_doc"`, `"connect_keyboard"`,
`"color1"` etc. Roughly:

```
{
  cn: { trigger_settings_doc: "...中文...", ... },
  en: { trigger_settings_doc: "Triggered once pressed...", ... },
  ...
}
```

Sample strings already extracted (for tone reference):

- `connect_keyboard` (EN): "Connect the Keyboard"
- `performance_title` (EN): "Select the keys to be adjusted"
- `trigger_settings_doc` (EN): "Triggered once pressed, reset
  once released. Continously active and instantly deactivate
  perform an immediate accuracy in FPS games"
- `tracking_help` (EN): "Once activated, any keystroke will be
  tracked, and multiple keystrokes can be tracked simultaneously"
- `reset_key_all_success` (EN): "Reset all keys successfully"
- `dark_mode` (EN): "Dark Mode"
- `err_msg_retry` (EN): "Failed to connect keyboard, please try
  it again(0)!"

These ALL have professional translations to the 7 languages in
the same bundle. Pulling them into `.resx` resources is a
mechanical text extraction, not a translation effort.

---

## Next steps (ordered by suspected value)

1. **Implement `BuildCreateRdtPacket` + wire into `BuildFullProfilePackets`**
   for RDT-mode syncs. Test on A75 Pro 0x0017. **If this fixes the
   phantom-RDT bug observed 2026-05-22, that's a confirmed P0 fix.**
2. **Capture identity-packet bytes from a newer firmware** (A75 Ultra
   0x55, A75 Master 0x55) to determine the `precision` byte location.
   Without that we can't dispatch correctly.
3. **Wire-trace the official tool** with a sniffer for RGB / knob / 
   firmware-side profile commands to confirm parameter meanings before
   building UI for them.
4. **Add `aa 00` reset packet** as a small refactor of the existing
   "Reset all keys" button. Low risk.
5. **Read-back capability** (Pull* variants) as a diagnostic tool —
   maybe a `--print-firmware-state` CLI flag that dumps what the
   keyboard actually has stored.

## Bundle re-derivation

To re-extract from the same source:

```
mkdir -p tools/captures/keybord-net-cn
cd tools/captures/keybord-net-cn
curl -sLO https://drunkdeer.keybord.net.cn/drunk/js/index.QC8Mvgui.js
curl -sLO https://drunkdeer.keybord.net.cn/drunk/js/vendor.CQzYxF6f.js
# Function inventory:
grep -oE "send[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+Data" index.QC8Mvgui.js | sort -u
# Specific function body (minified, lookup by name):
grep -oE "sendActionPointData:.{0,500}" index.QC8Mvgui.js | head -1
```

The Vite chunk-hash filenames (`QC8Mvgui`, `CQzYxF6f`) will rotate when
the site rebuilds. If the URLs 404, fetch `index.html` first and parse
the new chunk paths out of the `<script type="module">` tag.
